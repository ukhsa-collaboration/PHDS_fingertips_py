=========================================

Introduction
============


This is a python package to interact with Public Health England's
`Fingertips <https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/>`_ data tool. Fingertips is a
major repository of population and public health indicators for England.
The site presents the information in many ways to improve accessibility
for a wide range of audiences ranging from public health professionals
and researchers to the general public. The information presented is a
mixture of data available from other public sources, and those that are
available through user access agreements with other organisations. The
source of each indicator presented is available using the
`get_metadata_for_indicator()` function.


This package can be used to load data from the Fingertips API into
python for further use.

Installation
************

This packaged should be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: console

	pip install fingertips_py

Or it can be compiled from source (still requires pip):

.. code-block:: console

	pip install git+https://github.com/PublicHealthEngland/PHDS_fingertips_py.git

Usage
*****

fingertips_py should be imported and used in line with standard python
conventions. It is suggested that if the whole package is to be imported
 then the following convention is used:

>>> import fingertips_py as ftp

The package returns data in a variety of types dependent on the
function.

For more information on any function, you can use:

>>> help(*fingertips_py function name*)


Or you can view the documents [here](https://fingertips-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


Example
*******

This is an example of a workflow for retrieving data for the indicator
on *Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth* from the *Public Health Outcomes
Framework* profile.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

	import fingertips_py as ftp

	# Extract the metadata for a particular profile 
	phof = ftp.get_profile_by_name('public health outcomes framework')
	phof_meta = ftp.get_metadata_for_profile_as_dataframe(phof['Id'])
	
	# Extract metadata for indicators containing the string "Healthy"
	indicator_meta = phof_meta[phof_meta['Indicator'].str.contains('Healthy')]
	
	print(indicator_meta)

.. code-block::
   :linenos:
   
	Indicator ID	Indicator  						...
	90362		0.1i - Healthy life expectancy at birth  		...
	92543  		2.05ii - Proportion of children aged 2-2½yrs r		... 


We can see that the *Healthy life expectancy at birth* indicator has an
id of 90362. The data for this indicator at all geographical breakdowns
can be retrieved using `get_data_for_indicator_at_all_available_geographies()`


>>> healthy_life_data = ftp.get_data_for_indicator_at_all_available_geographies(90362)
